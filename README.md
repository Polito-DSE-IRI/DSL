# DSL
Data Science Lab

This course is one of the most challenging in Data Science and Engineering, not due to the complexity of the concepts themselves but because of their presentation.  
In this course, you'll gain familiarity with a range of machine learning algorithms. Basic knowledge of Python syntax and experience with popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas is expected

# Course Content  
The course material is organized into 8 parts:    
- Course introduction  
- Data preprocessing | Data exploration, feature engineering and data visualization  
- Association rules  
- Classification fundamentals  
- Clustering fundamentals  
- Regression analysis  
- Time series analysis
- Python

Additionally, there are 10 laboratory sessions. 


**But**  
You don’t need to master every topic or complete all the laboratory sessions to pass the course. However, the exam can be challenging, so it's important to understand some key concepts and guidelines. Don’t worry too much—focus on the essentials.

To achieve a top score (30 or 30 Lude), you'll need to invest significant time and effort in your studies.

# Exam  
The exam consists of two components:  
- Written Exam [20 points]
- Project (Group of 2 or Individual) [12 points]

### Wrtiten  
You will have 90 minutes to complete 12 questions, which include open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (with multiple correct answers and penalties for incorrect answers), and coding problems.  
A file with detailed information about the written exam will be provided to help you prepare and perform well.

### Project  
The project is a machine leaning project that is not very difficult but you need to dedicate a time to get high validation score. The project divided in 2 parts, Firstly coding that evalalute how your project evaluation metics is, this part is 4 points and secondly the report that evaluate your writing report skill. the report must be in the IEEE format (You can find the template in the Project folder) the you can get 8 point from this. In the Project folder you can see the a file that explane detail about project part that help you to know how to do the project and you can see some sample of report.

The project involves a machine learning task that is manageable but requires dedicated time to achieve a high validation score. The project is split into two parts:  
1. Coding Component (4 points): Evaluates the quality of your project’s metrics.
2. Report (8 points): Assesses your writing skills. The report must follow the IEEE format (a template is available in the Project folder).
   You can find a file in the Project folder with detailed guidelines on how to complete the project, along with sample reports.

# How to study 
It entirely depends on your goals.

If you want to gain a deep understanding of machine learning, this course may not be the best fit. While it provides a broad overview, it covers each topic only superficially. To truly learn machine learning, you'll need to explore additional resources beyond this course. Some recommended resources are listed in the 'Resources' section.

Here’s a suggestion: if you are keen on understanding the foundational concepts of machine learning algorithms, consider implementing the algorithms from scratch instead of relying solely on libraries like Scikit-learn. This approach will give you a deeper insight into the mechanics of machine learning algorithms. However, be aware that this method requires more time and does not guarantee a good exam score. Make sure to review the exam rules thoroughly.

If you prefer not to delve deeply into the algorithms, focus on understanding the course material at a high level. The 'How to Study' folder contains keywords and useful resources to aid in this process. You don’t need to master every detail; just grasp the main concepts to pass the course. After each section, review the exam questions to understand how they relate to the course material.

Completing laboratory sessions is not mandatory, and while they may not be crucial, they can help you prepare for the project. Sometimes, the project may resemble the labs, but you can still complete it without them.

Additionally, having a good teammate can be very beneficial, not only for this course but for all your courses. Choose your team wisely and work collaboratively.
