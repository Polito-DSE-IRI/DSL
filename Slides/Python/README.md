How to do the Project:

First, try to work on the project in pairs. This allows you to divide the tasks more efficiently.  
If you have experience in programming, especially in data science projects, it's a good idea to team up with someone who has strong report-writing skills.
Conversely, if you're not confident in programming, collaborate with a teammate who excels in coding.

Keep in mind that the project score is out of 12 points, divided into 4 points for the results and 8 points for the report. Therefore, writing a strong report is crucial.

The project itself isn’t too difficult, but the challenging part is managing your time effectively.
For both the first and second call, you’ll have about three weeks to complete the project (they assign it after the New Year holidays)[For the two other calls you have about two weeks for doing the project].
During this period, you'll need to balance studying for other courses exam while simultaneously working on the project.

Programming Overview:

The project can involve classification, regression, or clustering, with data types such as text, voice, or numeric. Depending on your assigned project, you will need to apply different preprocessing techniques and algorithms to achieve the best results.

Research Your Project:
Search for your project topic online, particularly on platforms like Kaggle. You may find similar projects that can provide insights or ideas.
If you find an exact match, be cautious. Professors often modify the project details (such as data, evaluation metrics, or lower bounds) to prevent the direct use of existing solutions. Use these projects primarily to understand the problem better and gather ideas.
Preprocessing:
Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques. Common tasks include balancing the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical data to numerical formats.
Depending on your dataset, you might need specialized preprocessing for voice or text data. You can find useful techniques and tutorials on YouTube.
Algorithms:
Choose and apply various algorithms based on your project type. For classification, try algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Experiment with different methods to achieve high evaluation metrics.
Be sure to review the project description for specific evaluation metrics used.
Public Leaderboard:
Utilize the public leaderboard to test your model’s predictions and see the results. Your results should be stable, and you can make up to 200 submissions.
Perform preprocessing, apply different algorithms, and use the leaderboard to gauge how well your model performs.
Iterate and Improve:
If your initial attempts are unsuccessful, adjust your preprocessing, algorithms, or hyperparameters. Finding a good solution may require several iterations, so don’t be discouraged—keep experimenting.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Tune your model’s hyperparameters using approaches such as Grid Search. Document the hyperparameter values you choose in your report and explain your choices.
Seek Help:
If you encounter problems, seek advice from friends or ask for help in the official Telegram group. Sharing ideas and getting feedback can assist you in resolving issues and improving your project.
By following these steps, you'll be better equipped to handle your project and achieve successful outcomes.


Report Overview:

It is advisable to write the report concurrently with the project. Follow the instructions on how to write the report and use the standard IEEE conference template available in this folder. Since the report constitutes 8 points of your grade, it is crucial to focus on producing a high-quality report. You can find sample reports in this folder to help guide you.

** Template Requirement:
Your report must be written using the standard IEEE conference template.
** Report Structure:
The report should be divided into the following five sections:
  1. Problem Overview
  2. Proposed Approach
    (a) Preprocessing
    (b) Model Selection
    (c) Hyperparameter Tuning
  3. Results
  4. Discussion
  5. References
Do not alter these sections; simply write about what you did within each section.

** Length:
The report must be no longer than 4 pages, excluding references.

1. Reference Samples:
Review other template reports to get an idea of how to structure and present your own report.
2. Problem Overview:
Paraphrase the project description, briefly explain the data (including the amount used for training and testing), and provide a concise overview of your project.
3. Proposed Approach:
(a) Preprocessing: Describe your preprocessing steps and their importance to the project. Include visual aids, such as correlation matrices, to support your explanation.
(b) Model Selection: Detail the algorithms you used and justify why you chose them. Explain why these algorithms are suitable for your project.
(c) Hyperparameter Tuning: Explain your approach to selecting hyperparameters, such as using Grid Search, and how you determined the best values.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will ensure that your report is well-organized and meets the required standards.
